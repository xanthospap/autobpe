#  README for xml/templates/
# --------------------------------------------------------- #

This folder contains a list of template files for creating xml
(actually docbook) processing summary report(s). They are used
by the script 'ddprocess', found in the src/bash/ directory.

These are only generic template files and do not hold any
actual information. They are populated by a list of bash scripts
under the xml/src directory.

Any changes in these files, should be followed by corresponding
changes in the scripts at xml/src directory and/or ddprocess.
