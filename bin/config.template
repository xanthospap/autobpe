##  Use CODE's REPRO13 products ('YES' or 'NO')
COD_REPRO13 = NO

##  Specify the station information file (.STA) to be used. Only provide the
##+ filename, the extension is automatically set to '.STA'. The search path
##+ for this file, is either ${TABLES_DIR}/sta/ or the campaign's /STA
##+ directory

##  The filename of the atl (i.e atmospheric tidal loading) corrections file.
##+ If the values is left blank, then no atl file is going to be used
##  If you do specify a file, do **not** use an extension; also the file

##  Specify the filename, with **no extension** of the pcv (ie. phase centre
##+ variations) file to be used. This option, works together with the 'ANTEX'
##+ option;
##  Case A. Both 'PCVINF' and 'ATXINF' are specified; this means that the
##+         'PCVINF' file is going to be updated using the 'ATXINF' file.
##+         The files needed, are:
##+         ${TABLES_DIR}/atx/${ATXINF} and
##+         ${TABLES_DIR}/pcv/${PCVINF}.${PCV_EXT}, or
##+         ${P}/${CAMPAIGN}/OUT/${PCVINF}.${PCV_EXT}
##  Case B. The 'PCVINF' but 'ATXINF' is empty; this means that the file
##+         'PCVINF' is going to be used as is for the proccessing. In this
##+         case the 'PCVINF' should be found in either:
##+         ${TABLES_DIR}/pcv/${PCVINF}.${PCVEXT} , or
##+         ${X}/GEN/${PCVINF}.${PCVEXT}
##  Case C. Only 'ATXINF' is specified. In this case this (antex) file is
##+         going to be used to produce a PCV file. The antex file should be
##+         ${TABLES_DIR}/atx/${ATXINF}

##  Set this option to 'YES' or 'NO' to use EUREF's weekly exclusion list.

##  Specify where the saved (output) files are going to be placed. If you want
##+ them to be saved at this HOST, then only set the 'SAVE_DIR_DIR' variable.
##+ Else, you also need to specify a HOST ('SAVE_DIR_HOST') and a username
##+ ('SAVE_DIR_URN') and password ('SAVE_DIR_PSS') if needed.
##  Note that the program 'ftp' will be used to do the transfer (if needed)
##
##  Warning: The saved products will actually be placed **not** in the folder 
##+ 'SAVE_DIR_DIR' but in ${SAVE_DIR_DIR}/YYYY/DDD
