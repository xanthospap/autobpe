+ Compiler Support
------------------
  XYZ2FLH uses the new C++11 (formerly known as C++0x) standard. The program is
  tested on GCC compilers for version later than 4.2. Support for c++11 on GCC 
  follows the matrix (see http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html)
    GCC 4.3 C++0x Status
    GCC 4.4 C++0x Status
    GCC 4.5 C++0x Status
    GCC 4.6 C++0x Status
    GCC 4.7 C++11 Status
    GCC 4.8 C++11 Status
  When using a GCC compiler earlier than 4.7 thange the flag -std=c++11 to     
  -std=c++0x in the makefile.
