\subsection{Routine DD processsing}
\label{r_dd_proc}

\subsubsection{Prequisities}
Before running the ddprocess \autoref{sec:ddprocess} script to process 
GPS/GNSS data, the following will be needed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The bernutils library; this is a set of Python modules to assist 
in GPS/GNSS processing and related activities. The package can be found at
\url{https://github.com/xanthospap/autobpe}.
\item Related to the bernutils package are a number of programs (scripts)
to perform a huge number of divergent tasks. They are written in various
programing languages (Python, shell/bash, awk, etc ..) and a number of them
make (at least the Python ones) use the bernutils modules.
These programs can be found in \url{https://github.com/xanthospap/autobpe},
in the \texttt{/bin} directory.
\item Some of the programs (mentioned above), are designed to connect to a
MySQL database to extract vital information (e.g. station names, remote servers,
et ..).
\item Of-course, you need Bernese GNSS Software at least version 5.2
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{TABLES} directory.
