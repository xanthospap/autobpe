wgetregrnx \- AutoBpe Software Collection
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
AutoBpe Software Collection is a collection of tools that accomodates
automatic processing of GNSS data mainly via Bernese GNSS.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wgetregrnx
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]... \fI\-y [YEAR]\fR \fI\-d [DAY OF YEAR]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Download RINEX files (Hatanaka compressed) for regional stations for a specific date. The data centers used in this script to
download the files, can be listed using the \fB\-l\fR option.
.PP
Mandatory arguments for long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stations\fR
specify stations to download seperated by whitespace (e.g -s penc pdel ...), see \fBSTATION PRIORITY\fR
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-station-file\fR
give a file specifying stations to be downloaded. The file must have one line, where each station is seperated
by a whitespace character, see \fBSTATION PRIORITY\fR
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-year\fR
specify year (4-digits)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-doy\fR
specify day of year
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output-directory\fR
specify output directory where the downloaded files are going to be saved (default ./)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-max-stations\fR
specify a station limit. When this limit is reached, no more stations are going to be
downloaded.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-force-remove\fR
if a file is found with the same name as the one to be downloaded, it will be deleted before downloading.
The default behaviour is that if a file is found with the same name as the one to be downloaded, then
the file will \fBNOT\fR be downloaded but counted as downloaded.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-decompress\fR
decompress the downloaded files (default do not decompress). If this switch is not enabled and a file
is found matching a file to be downloaded but not compressed, then the existing file is going to be
compressed (to match exactly the file as it would be downloaded).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-upper-case\fR
truncate all downloaded files to upper case letters.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
supress all messages, except for errors.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
only print the help message and exit
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
only print version message and exit
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-fix-header\fR
fix header (MARKER NAME field in RINEX) to match the station's name
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list-available\fR
list all regional gnss stations which can be downloaded via this script and exit
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The program will return an integer, denoting the exit status. There are three distinct cases,
.IP \[bu] 2
Exit Status = 255-2; user has not provided any stations to download
.IP \[bu] 2
Exit Status = 255-1; this denotes that an error has occured
.IP \[bu] 2
Exit Status >=0 ; this denotes that the program had a seccesseful run and downloaded this many station files.
Note that some of the stations may have not actualy been downloaded by this run, but the wanted file(s) was
found.
.SH "STATION PRIORITY"
In case both -s and -f switches are used, the order of the stations is first 
the -s stations and then the -f ones (e.g > wgetregrnx -s sta1 sta2 -f filename ...
and filename has stations sta3 sta4, then the list of stations to download will be:
sta1 sta2 sta3 sta4). The order of stations is crucial when the -m switch is specified.
.SH "DEPENDANCIES"
The python library bpepy.gpstime must be installed and
set in the python path variable.
In order to download data from the NOA2 server, the programs
teqc, runpkr00 and rnx2crx must be installed and set in the
PATH variable.
