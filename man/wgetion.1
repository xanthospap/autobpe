Note that if \fB-t\fR is not turned on (default), then the script will search for whatever type is available 
(starting from final,then rapid and then for ultra-rapid) and download the first file that it finds.

      rapid -> CORWWWWD.ION.Z from CODWWWWD.ION_R
ultra-rapid -> COUWWWWD.ION.Z from COD.ION_U

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
