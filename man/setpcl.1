setpcl \- AutoBpe Software Collection
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
AutoBpe Software Collection is a collection of tools that accomodates
automatic processing of GNSS data mainly via Bernese GNSS.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setpcl
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Set variables in .PCL and .PCF file(s) to process data in automatic mode. The .PCL file to
edit is ntua_pcs.pl. The .PCF is chosen by the user. Both scripts (as well as other
specified files) must be in Bernese52 - specific directories.
.PP
Mandatory arguments for long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-analysis-center=\fR
Specify the analysis center; this can be e.g. igs
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bernese-loadvar=\fR
Specify the Bernese LOADGPS.setvar file; this is needed to resolve the Bernese-related path variables. All other
specified input files (e.g. .BLQ) are searched in the Bernese-specific directories.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-campaign=\fR
Specify campaign name (to be processed). The directory \$P/CAMPAIGN must be present.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-solution-id=\fR
Specify the solution id, for naming of product files. The solution id will have an effect on the naming of the Final, Preliminery
and Size-Reduced solutionfiles. If e.g. the solution-id is set to NTA, then
the Final solution files will be named NTA, the preliminery NTP and the size-reduced NTR.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pcf-file=\fR
Specify the .PCF file to be edited. This file must be present in /.../GPSUSER52/PCF/. No path,
only the filename \fBwithout the extension\fR is required. The extension is supposed to be .PCF and is automatically
added to the filename when needed.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-pcv-file=\fR
Specify the .PCV file to be edited. This file must be present in /.../BERN52/GPS/GEN/. No path,
only the filename \fBwithout extension\fR is required. The extension is supposed to be .I08 and is automatically
added to the filename when needed.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-satellite-system=\fR
Specify the Satellite System to be used in the processing. This can be \fBgps\fR or \fBmixed\fR. Mixed actually
translates to gps plus glonass.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-elevation-angle=\fR
Specify the elevation angle in degrees. An integer number is expected.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-blq=\fR
Specify the ocean tide-loading correction file, blq format (with CMC). This file must be present in
/.../GPSDATA/CAMPAIGN52/CAMPAIGN/STA/. Only filename required, \fBno path, no extension\fR. The extension is 
supposed to be .BLQ and is automatically added to the filename when needed.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-atl=\fR
Specify the atmospheric tide-loading correction file (with CMC). This file must be present in
/.../GPSDATA/CAMPAIGN52/CAMPAIGN/STA/. Only filename required, \fBno path, no extension\fR. The extension is 
supposed to be .ATL and is automatically added to the filename when needed.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
only print the help message and exit
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
only print version message and exit
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The program will return an integer, denoting the exit status:
.IP \[bu] 2
Exit Status = 255-2; Error; some variable cannot be set
.IP \[bu] 2
Exit Status = 255-1; Error
.IP \[bu] 2
Exit Status =0; Success
.SH "EXAMPLE USAGE"
\fB-a emp -b LOADGPS.setvar -c CAMPGN -i NTA -p S_PCF -f S_PCV -s mixed -e 7 -l S_BLQ -t S_ATL\fR
This command, will edit the S_PCF.PCF file (found in /.../GPSUSER52/PCF/) as follows:
.nf
