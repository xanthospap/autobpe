Download VMF1 (Vienna Mapping Function) grid files. These files are made available by
http://ggosatm.hg.tuwien.ac.at. The script will first search for the grid files in
http://ggosatm.hg.tuwien.ac.at/DELAY/GRID/VMFG and if a file is missing it will susequently
search and download the respective forecast file. For a specific day, 5 files must be
downloaded (including the first file of next day). Note that the hourly files will be merged 
to a whole-day grid file. I.e if year is 2014 and doy is 331, the script will download 5 
seperate hourly files VMFG_20141127.H00, VMFG_20141127.H06, VMFG_20141127.H12, VMFG_20141127.H18 and
VMFG_20141128.H00) and merge them to the file VMFG_2014331. The type of the file is reported in stdout, .e.g.
.nf
(wgetvmf1) Downloaded VMF1 grid file VMFG_20141126.H18 (final) ; merged to VMFG_2014
(wgetvmf1) Downloaded VMF1 grid file VMFG_20141127.H00 (prediction) ; merged to VMFG_2014
